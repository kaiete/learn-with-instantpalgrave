            <b>Part 1: Information</b><br>
            kaiete or Learn with Instant Palgrave are not liable if information provided in "lessons" is incorrect in any way. <br>
            We recommend that you check with a reliable source if any information provided seems incorrect. <br>
            If you find any incorrect information, please contact us with an <a href="http://github.com/kaiete/learn-with-instantpalgrave/issues">issue on GitHub.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 2: Monetization</b><br>
            I (kaiete) don't plan to make money from Palgrave Learn - I made it simply for fun. Please respect that, and don't try to make money from it yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 3: Disruption</b><br>
            You must not attempt (deliberately) to take down or hack any of the GitHub Pages servers Palgrave Learn runs on.<br>
            Simple as that.
            <br>
            Wasn't that like the shortest terms of service ever?
            Let's <a href="http://kaiete.uk/learn-with-instantpalgrave">get back to it</a>!
